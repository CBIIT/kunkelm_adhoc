drugTrackerList.xhtml 
selectionMode to multiple
action showSelectedDrugTrackers in Controller; dialogSelectedDrugTrackers

all dialogs moved to dialogXXX.xhtml

TODO! experiment with js for highlight cells in dataGrid 

18Feb2013

Translate methods to Util class
substructureSearch: StandardizedSmiles returns translated to DrugTrackerVO

HeapSpace errors?   BRAIN DEAD!   If searches return nothing, don't run Criteria search on empty nscList

02Mar2013

switch structure searches to Cmpd model

03Mar2013

implement ListManager as WebService

blockUI during structure searches

07Mar2013

fileUpload, start work on parsing SDFile (modify CDK so that skip returns an empty molecule)

08Mar2013

fix .xhtml pages to accomodate refactoring of CmpdVO in novumservices

refactored ServiceTranslators to use dozer

09Mar2013

DrugTracker to internal tab

TODO! dialogs to tabs when possible

10Mar2013

added load structure by NSC to jchempaint
refactored smiles and mol fields to hidden fields

13Mar2013

dozer failing translate AdHocCmpd -> createAdHocList
List->Set or dynamicList causing problem?

14Mar2013

cmpdFragmentLayout

15Mar2013 

persistence of adHocCmpd WORKS! (need to do final check create with ONLY entities

DeleteList - had to REFACTOR association from NSC_NOVUM_LIST_MEMBER to CMPD to cascade="none"

adHocCmpds are deleted with their list, for nsc_cmpds only the reference to the cmpd is deleted

16Mar2013

refactor to separate owner and PUBLIC lists

22Mar2013

DrugTracker to JPA!

Clone DrugTrackerWebApplication->DCTDDataSystem

rework novumservices uml -> uml folder under project

implement EntityToValueObject

ListManagerController to JPA

<Missing dates of various stuff>

28Mar2013

REFACTOR! Cmpd->NscCmpd, add Abstract top-level Abstract Cmpd to include NscCmpd and AdHocCmpd

track down multiplicity errors in the model many-to-many for cmpd<->cmpd_set, cmpd<->project_code

regenerate entity classes

Clone DrugTrackerController to use as template for CmpdController

Sat 30Mar2013

Clean out drugTrackers stuff

Add GeneratorSequences to AdHoc entity classes and CmpdList, CmpdListMember classes

S L O W cmpd fetch with JPA -> examining domain model

NscCmpd->CmpdRelated should be 1 -> 0..* NOT 0..*->0..*; sets of related cmpds are property of a single cmpd

removed CmpdCas -> nsc_cmpd.cas_string

QuickView created for Cmpd search to use in byReference calls

Sun 31Mar2013

BUG! JPA disjunction query of entities with criteria that include referenced entities uses JOIN instead of LEFT OUTER JOIN

BUG! (known problem) JPA getReference actually loads entire object when adding to CmpdListMember or deleting from CmpdListMember

Experiment with NativeQuery inserts to CmpdListMember - this works, but kludgey...

Start experimenting with hibernate reveng

Mon 01Apr2013

YAY! hibernate does NOT load entire hierarchy when getting a ref to Cmpd

hibernate reveng doesn't support subclasses, experiment with import androMDA classes and mappings

Tue 02Apr2013

FINALLY discovered session.save("EntityName", object) for persisting a subclass to its base.

failed to lazily initialize a collection of role: androdomain.CmpdListImpl.cmpdListMembers, no session or session was closed =>
modify Helpers to return VO with internal, class-level variables to pass Entities when needed, e.e. createList(findByNsc(nscIdList))

ClassCastException: androdomain.CmpdImpl$$EnhancerByCGLIB$$2477f013 => lazy="false" for Cmpd->NscCmpd or AdHocCmpd
found and added util.Unproxy.java to the application

Wed 03Apr2013

GIVE UP on Primefaces confirmDialog.  SOMETHING just isn't right.

ListLogic => have to go in and customize the Compartor methods in CmpdVO to 
match by Id, adHocId 

create_views.sql to create de-normalized cmpd with parent fragment for fast retrieval

TODO!
add new "originalAdHocId to allow tracking of cloned adHocCmpds
refactor nsc.cmpdId to nscCmpdId, move cmpdId to Cmpd
add comments, descriptors, etc. to CmpdListMember
ponder OWNER, SOURCE on Cmpd?

Thu 04Apr2013

Many, various

Fri 05Apr2013

generator = sequence tags on all Entity

backup ENTIRE PROJECT before start mods to use completely-flat CmpdView instead of Cmpd

Sat 06Apr2013

removed hib and jpa remnants

Mon 08Apr2013 Homework

1::0..1 association to CmpdView
util.Transform to translate CmpdView into CmpdVO 

Wed 10Apr2013 Homework

moved CmpdView to CmpdListMember; otherwise all accessors have to call .getCmpd().getCmpdView() which loads NscCmpd->lots of 1::many

COMPLETELY disconnected CmpdView from model; HelperXXX methods will resolve calls against CmpdView

TODO! POLICE all cascade="delete" mappings

Thu 11Apr2013

fromWork design:  toCmpdListVO:   CmpdList.hbm.xml translate the CLM to VO while building
list of id for contained cmpds, store in HashMap<cmpdId, clmVO>, fetch all CmpdView via Helper, resolve against HashMap

deleteList:  fetch list, store cmpdId numbers, search AdHocCmpd by id, delete any found

extend cmpd_view to include adHocCmpd

Fri 12Apr2013

add adHocCmpdParentFragment to adHocCmpd part of model

Sat 13Apr2013

FINALLY! sdf upload works -> problem was Long.valueOf(nsc) when nsc was null -> track down and ELIMINATE remaining Long values in domain model
implement cmpd.countCmpdFragments

DELETE confirmation dialog now WORKS! (added remoteCommand propertyListeners with customized names by appending CmpdListId)

added omnifaces 
added faces-config.xml

Wed 22May2013

modified dtd in .hbm.xml files to use classpath instead of web url so that hibernate.cfg.xml parsing won't fail when 
computer is not connected to the net

Fri 24May2013

Added blockUI for ListLogic HAD TO LOCATE THE blockUI component as direct child of the form view, 
otherwise it wouldn't release the screen on hide();

Tue 18Jun2013

need to restore fragments to the cmpd view data model, and TransformCmpdViewToVO methods

Wed 28Aug2013

moving SubStructure search results to separate tab adjacent to JChemPaint, removed dialogSubstructureSearch from ui:include

Fri/Sat 30, 31Aug2013

histogram grid with containers based on hist4j

implemented stand-along ketcher -> BROKEN, case of SMILES string C/c is WRONG! NUKE THIS!

"ActiveList" tab added to outerTabView, "Substructure Searches" moved from outerTabView to listManager
had to RENAME all of the form elements :dataSystemForm:outerTabView -> :dataSystemForm:outerTabView:

this is BROKEN, some aspect of js/AJAX doesn't work if Substructure Searches isn't directly underneate outerTabView

Sun 01Sept2013

working on custom histogram classes that include ArrayList<CmpdVO> inside the bins
added Boolean selected to CmpdListVO, CmpdListMemberVO, CmpdVO,

Custom Histogram class, reworking controller/dialogHistograms to use new model

Tue 03Sep2013

migrate from NetBeans ant project to maven

Fri 06Sep2013

reworked StructureServlet to use cdk-export from Scripps.  Need to figure out highlighting for lightweight implementation.

Sat 07Sep2013 9AM

all paths (search, upload, view) now lead to the "Active List" tab
DELETE action modified to use new field listForDelete
performDelete renamed to handleDelete since it is inside a confirmation dialog

reworked some blockUI -> dialogs

Sun 08Sep2013 6PM
