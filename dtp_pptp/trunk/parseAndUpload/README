To upload the raw mouse data files:

----------File editing:

Export from .xls files as .csv stats page from stats workbook, censored page from results workbook, response summary page from results workbook and event times from event times workbook.

Insert a comment symbol ('#') as the first character in the column headers row and in any empty rows.

Convert all tab delimiters to commas.

Empty fields require a . placeholder.   i.e.   ,,,   needs to be   ,.,.,.   

Trim all blank spaces.

There are at least five different layouts for the stats files with various added/missing columns.   The .java files have the differences hard-coded by compound.   

File names and locations:

The files should be in a subdirectory csvFiles. The file names for compound 0501 are 0501stats.csv, 0501censored.csv, 0501events.csv, 0501responsesummary.csv 

----------Java processing:

Run the callJavaParsers.sh script file.  This calls the three separate java programs which parse the spreadsheet .csv files into a partially-normalized format for uploading to Postgres.

The output files are written to the csvFiles subdirectory and have a .processed extension.

For each of the different .processed files (stats, censored, etc) a single big rollup file is created.

----------Postgres upload and processing:

Generate database from pptp model.

Populate the "type" tables by running the script restoreKeyTables.sql   This uses the various table.dump files to insert all 
of the data for creation and resolution of foreign keys for compounds, cell lines, mice, etc.

Create the "master" table by running createMasterLookup.sql.  This resolves together many of the identifier files to
simplify determining the foreign keys among the various data tables.

Run the UploadAndResolveCompoundData.sql postgres script

----------processing Affymetrix data

Run shell script processAffy.sh

Concatenate all of the processed files to one file: big.processed

uploadAndResolveAffyData.sql




---------------------------DATA Export for reimport into dedicated COMPARE

Run script exportAffyDataToCompare.sql to generate a series of files that can be imported
into Oracle version of COMPARE.

Upload order is important for foreign-key constraints:

export_cell_line.csv
export_test_result_type.csv
export_vector_ident.csv
export_mol_targ_ident.csv
export_vector.csv
